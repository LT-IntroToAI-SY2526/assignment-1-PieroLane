# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
I have never used any coding language and have no coding experience so I have nothing to compare it to.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI effectively by using the correct ways to formulate a prompt so it wuld not give me the answer to what I asked it but it would give me a clear answer or response to what I asked it
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
Everythjing was challenging because I have no understanding or experience with code so I asked Ai to explain it to me without giving me the answer.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I asked the Ai to act like a Professor and explain the code I gave it and ways I could fix it without giving me just the right code.
